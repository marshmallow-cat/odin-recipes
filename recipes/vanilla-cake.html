        <h2>Recipe for Vegan Basic Vanilla Cake</h2>
        This is a dense, yet somewhat spongy basic vegan cake. It can be topped with a basic vegan chocolate or vegan vanilla buttercream frosting. A nice, easy, basic, homemade favorite that doesn't taste like a box mix AND can be used as a tasty vegan birthday cake! Cool completely before topping with your favorite vegan buttercream frosting.
