        <h2>Recipe for Vegan Apple Pie</h2>
        This apple pie is delicious! With no animal products, the crust is very buttery and light. Serve right out of the oven, chilled, or slightly warmed.
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Crust:
                <ul>
                   <li>2 &frac13; cups all-purpose flour</li>
                   <li>1 cup vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance)</li>
                   <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                   <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                   <li>&frac14; cup ice water</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Filling:
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
                    <li>&frac12; cup vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance)</li>
                    <li>&frac14; cup white sugar</li>
                    <li>&frac14; cup rice milk</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>&frac12; teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                    <li>7 Granny Smith apples-peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup vegan margarine, 1 tablespoon white sugar, and salt in a food processor; pulse until mixture clumps together. Pour water in slowly and pulse a few times until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a flat work surface; knead for 30 seconds and shape into a disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Dust a flat work surface with flour. Roll dough out into two 10-inch crusts. Press 1 crust gently into a 9-inch pie plate.</li>
            <li>Combine brown sugar, 1/2 cup vegan margarine, 1/4 cup white sugar, rice milk, 3 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until margarine melts and brown sugar is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place apple slices in a large bowl. Pour brown sugar mixture on top; mix until apples are evenly coated. Pile apples into the bottom crust. Cover with second crust. Cut slits in the top crust with a sharp knife.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and apples are semitranslucent, 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
