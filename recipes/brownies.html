        <h2>Recipe for Vegan Brownies</h2>
        These brownies are very gooey, which is a good thing in my book. However, if you prefer them a little more solid, you'll need to bake the brownies longer than the recommended time. Great for people with egg or dairy allergies, too!
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>&frac34; cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Stir together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Pour in water, vegetable oil, and vanilla; mix until well-blended. Spread evenly in the prepared dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is no longer shiny, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting into 16 squares.</li>
        </ol>
